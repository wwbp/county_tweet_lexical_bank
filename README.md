:warning: Due to problems with LFS, we are temporarily hosting the data [here](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4895623) at Zenodo.  

County level word and topic loading derived from a 10% Twitter sample from 2009-2015. Anonymized linguistic features extracted from over 1.5 billion English U.S County mapped tweets.

## Data

Available in both csv format and as a MySQL dump. All tables are in sparse (long) format.



### Unigrams

Approximately 24,000 most frequenct unigrams. All urls replaced with `<URL>` and @-mentions replaced with `<USER>`.

* `group_id`: County FIPS code
* `feat`: unigram
* `value`: Number of times the unigram was used by the county
* `group_norm`: Average number of times the feature was used by the county (`value / number of users in county`)

### Facebook Topics

Topic loadings per county using a set of 2000 topics captured in over 14 million Facebook status updates derived via Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) ([see full details on topic derivation](http://wwbp.org/publications.html#p7)). Topics, words per topic and conditional probailities available [here](https://github.com/wwbp/facebook_topics).

* `group_id`: County FIPS code
* `feat`: Topic id
* `value`: Number of times a word in the topic was used by the county
* `group_norm`: Relative frequency of topic use by county

## Data Processing

Twitter data was processed using the following rules:

1. Each tweet was mapped to a U.S. County using tweet level latitude / longitude information and user level profile free text ([full details here](http://wwbp.org/publications.html#p8)).
2. Filtered for English using [langid](https://github.com/saffsd/langid.py).
3. Users with less than 30 tweets were removed.
4. Counties with less than 100 users were removed.

Linguistic features process:

1. Unigram relative frequencies extracted for each user.
2. User level relative frequencies are averaged to the county.
3. Topic loadings calculated using county level unigram relative frequencies.
